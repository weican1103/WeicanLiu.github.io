The need for electricity has increased as a result of societal development and industrial transformation. Regularly accurate short-term electricity Forecasting is crucial to maintaining the security, effectiveness, and economy of the power grid. However, conventional forecasting models find it difficult to achieve the load forecast accuracy needed by the current power system because of the volatility and unpredictability of electricity load time series. We suggest a brand-new hybrid load forecasting model with two modules in order to accomplish this. The first is a data augmentation module that, when only load data are used, integrates peak and trend data as auxiliary data into the data from the denoised time series to produce extremely accurate forecasting results. The deep learning module comes in second. In order to improve load accuracy, we have proposed a new deep learning predictive module that combines the Transformer architecture with multi-layer Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). Using three load forecasting datasets from Australia, we ran experiments. The findings demonstrate that, when compared to the classical model, our designed framework achieves the highest accuracy in a number of indicators.
