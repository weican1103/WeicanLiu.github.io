Accurate load forecasting is crucial for efficient power system management. Yet, it is particularly challenging during critical days, such as weekends and holidays, due to limited data samples and atypical load patterns. This study presents a tailored load prediction framework that leverages data preprocessing and deep learning to address these challenges. The framework incorporates a noise-reduction step, trend information, and critical day indicators into the data preprocessing phase. The deep learning component integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for temporal feature analysis, and a Transformer to enhance forecasting accuracy through an encoder-decoder architecture and mixed spatio-temporal feature learning. Evaluation of two years of electricity load data from a southern Chinese industrial city confirms the frameworkâ€™s efficacy in improving load forecasting during critical periods.
