Hi everyone! I am Weican Liu (柳炜灿), a Master student in Communication Engineering from the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) at Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof. Yan XU](https://eexuyan.github.io/soda/index.html). Previously, I worked as an Algorithm Engineer Intern at the [Cross-Straits Tsinghua Research Institute](https://tsinghua-hx.org.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Nangjie Gong](https://sites.google.com/site/gongnanjie/home). Additionally, I worked as a Research Assistant at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Chenye Wu](https://www.wuchenye.cn/index-cn.html). Before that, I obtained a bachelor’s degree at the School of Computer and Communication Engineering, [Northeastern University](https://www.neuq.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yinghua Han](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293173100). I ranked in the top 15% in the School of Computer and Communication Engineering, NEU with a GPA of (86/100).

**My Interests**
======
1. **Hybrid Framework Design for Ultra-short-term Time-Series Prediction**: My work involves the integration of various modeling approaches (such as ensemble model, combined model, and strategies after prediction) to enhance the accuracy of ultra-short-term forecasts. By combining different predictive models, we aim to leverage their respective strengths and mitigate their weaknesses, leading to superior prediction performance for critical applications like real-time energy dispatch and trading. We also explore the impact of data processing on prediction results, including data augmentation, feature engineering, de-nosing strategy, and some fuzzy methods.

2. **Innovative Transfer Strategies for Few-shot Learning Problems**: I am investigating how to effectively adapt pre-trained models to new, limited-data contexts within the energy sector. This includes creating robust models that can generalize well from minor data quantity, thereby addressing the data scarcity issue prevalent in many specialized energy applications. Furthermore, accurately leveraging low-frequency data to reconstruct high-frequency data and performing knowledge transfer in wind power forecasting problems is also a topic of interest.

3. **Efficient NILM Techniques for Unknown Appliance Detection**: In real household scenarios, users often add new appliances, making it an intriguing challenge to enhance the accuracy of recognizing previously unkown appliances.

4. **Enhancing Load Forecasting Accuracy for critical Days**: Due to the limited sample size and the influence of various factors on load variation patterns, the volatility of critical days significantly differs from that of regular weekdays. Leveraging features such as extreme weather conditions and holiday-specific information to improve load forecasting accuracy for holidays presents an interesting challenge.
