Hi everyone! I am Weican Liu (柳炜灿), a Master's student in Communication Engineering from the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) at Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof. Yan XU](https://eexuyan.github.io/soda/index.html). I earned my bachelor's degree in Communication Engineering from the School of Computer and Communication Engineering at Northeastern University, supervised by [Prof. Yinghua Han](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37293173100). I was a visiting student researcher at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, from Jun. 2023 to Apr. 2024, supervised by [Prof. Chenye Wu](https://www.wuchenye.cn/index-cn.html). I was a visiting student researcher at North China Electric Power University from Apr. 2025 to Aug. 2025, supervised by [Prof. Fan Hang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=piQg--AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and [Prof. Dunnan Liu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085703632). My GPA in Master's is currently 3.30/5.00 (83/100), and in Bachelor's is 3.40/5.00 (84/100). I've collaborated with scholars from universities including NTU, CUHKSZ, Tsinghua University, Nanjing University, Southeast University, and North China Electric Power University. Our research has been published in international journals such as Applied Energy, Energy, Renewable Energy, and Information Fusion.

**Research Interests**
======
My research focuses on **AI for Energy Prediction**, including Load, PV, EV, Electricity Price, and Wind Power, with broad interests in deep learning, economic dispatch, and power systems. Previously, my work focused on developing various hybrid time series forecasting models to improve energy prediction accuracy, which was to address the complexity and nonlinearity of energy data to promote efficient renewable energy grid integration. Currently, my research primarily focuses on developing efficient and accurate **end-to-end forecasting and scheduling models**. My aim is to address the challenge of objective function mismatch between forecasting and dispatching. Additionally, I've begun exploring the role of **large language models (LLMs)** in energy forecasting, to leverage large-scale data to research and optimize electric vehicle (EV) charging station planning.
